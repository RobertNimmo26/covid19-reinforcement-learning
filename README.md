## Abstract

The report investiaged the performance of three agents - random, deterministic and Q-Learning agent - and compared the performance of these agents against each other using three different simulated epidemic environment conditions. Utilising previous evaluation results, the report looked at possible improvements to the Q-Learning agent to perform better in the stochastic environment. It was found that the Q-Learning agent performed the best and produce the most sensible policies, although in a real life instance none of the policies produced by the agents could be fully used to inform decisions due to the limitations in the environment and other social factors involved.

## ViRL enviroment

ViRL is an Epidemics Reinforcement Learning Environment. Agents are tasked with controlling the spread of a virus with one of four non-medical policy interventions: (i) lockdown, (ii)track & trace, (iii) social distancing & masks, (iv) none.
